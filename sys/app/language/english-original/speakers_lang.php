	$lang['speakers.1.abstract']="Geological and hydrometeorological phenomena obey laws still 
	partially unknown. They affect the world population sitting in risk sites, disregarding construction 
	codes as well as zones affected by floods or tides. All countries bordering the Pacific Fire Belt, 
	as well as Caribbean countries, experiment earthquakes from time to time. This is the reason for our 
	design of the “Anti seismic Operating Plan for Protection of Civil Population.”  Detailed elsewhere, 
	it describes functions and actions that must be carried out by the government’s cabinet in order to
	 attend and solve the destructive effects that an earthquake provokes upon its inhabitants.  
	 This Operating Plan assumes a Control Center (CCD), several Site Coordinators as required 
	 (one in each affected place) and twelve Work Groups that will receive and send instructions 
	 (The Control Center issues macro-orders to each group and coordinates their operations; each 
	 group implements those macro-orders through more detailed orders to its operating personnel),
	  status reports, requests for quantities and types of goods, supplies (blood, medicines), among 
	  many others. Among the groups are bulk providers such as the Medical Facilities and other resources 
	  that are centrally coordinated (from Medical headquarters, say). It heavily relies on Internet 
	  (cable and satellite) and radio communication, since electricity, telephone and other communications 
	  media are often reduced or absent, as observed in recent catastrophes.<br/><br/>
      The first hours after a large size earthquake are crucial. Time and readiness are decisive 
	  to provide an acceptable attention to the victims. Thus, it is essential to include Informatics 
	  in the handling of the many activities, mostly distributed in time and space, that need to be 
	  simultaneously (but harmonically) carried out. Also, follow-up and accountability are facilitated 
	   if computers are used.<br/><br/>  
	   <b>Impacted countries:</b><br/> 
	   The Pacific Fire Belt is situated in the coasts of 
	   the Pacific Ocean; it concentrates some of the most important subductive zones of the world, 
	   which causes intense seismic and volcanic activity (60% of the world seismic activity). 
	   Main affected countries are: Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Central America 
	   (Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala) Mexico,
	    United States, Canada, Aleutian Islands, coasts and islands of Russia, Japan, 
		China, Taiwan, Philippines , Indonesia, New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand. ";

	 (HPiC). The goal is to design and develop algorithms and programming frameworks for large 
	 interactive applications, taking advantage of the resources offered by hybrid multi-core

	 applications with a strong 3D aspect like scientific visualization or virtual reality.";
	 
	$lang['speakers.2.abstract'] ="Applications related to networked 3D games or social networks, virtual
	 and augmented reality, associate users and programs to create interactive environments
    mixing reality with 3D virtual data.  Various rendering modalities as well as sensors to acquire 
    data on the real world are combined.  Such applications are computationally demanding as interactivity
    imposes strong time constraints while users continuously request  more complex synthetic environments.
    Scientific simulations  steadily  increase their complexity and the amount of data produced.<br/><br/> 
	 
    Scientists need new tools to  cope with this complexity.  3D rendering and interactivity is one key
    component  to help them  understand the simulation behavior.  One challenge is to identify  
	relevant data representations and interaction metaphors  adapted to the domain and the user 
	perception capabilities.  
    This  often  relies on  heavy processing  that require  adapted parallelizations and  an efficient coupling 
    with the simulation in the demanding  context of supercomputers. <br/><br/>
	 The emergence of multi-core processors,
    programmable GPUs,  cloud  computing and large scale computing plat!
    forms  offers new opportunities to tackle these challenges. In this talk after an overview of existing 
    developments, we will intend to identify the  challenges, trends  and new usages  that  emerge
    from High Performance Interactive Computing (HPiC). ";

    Environmentally sustainable computer systems is a research area that has expanded
    rapidly within the fields of computer science and engineering, optimization
    resources as well as other disciplines. It refers to the administration of resources

   and research related to the environment, and so on. <br/><br/>
    This talk focuses on a new scheduling system for managing and
    optimization strategies for parallel jobs in Grid systems and Cloud-friendly
    environment. We will discuss briefly the problems that have arisen with respect to these
    strategies. The sustainable management approach is to provide allocation strategies
